The core languages of the Web are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown. Webpages are structured with HTML, styled with CSS, given logic and made interactive with JavaScript, and typically documented with Markdown. Learning these languages and understanding the way they interact is integral to developing for the Web.
